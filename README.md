## Larix demographics

### Collaboration with Dan Turck & Dave Tank

<br>

This repository contains my code for fitting demographic models and estimating model parameters for Dan's Larix data.


### Models

Models are contained in the `Models` directory. Each contains a `.tpl` and `.est` file that specify the coalescent model for FastSimCoal. We use fastsimcoal26. 



### add in complete FSC version
