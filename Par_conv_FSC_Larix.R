#### This script takes the parameter estimates from the best runs of the best models for FSC runs on
####    Larix datasets and converts the units and makes a table of them
####    this *should* work with any number of populations with divergence times, secondary contact times
####    and migration rates: requires that migration rates are specified such that the parameter names include the numbers of 
####    the populations between which migration is occurring and that these same numbers are included in the 
####    population names in a consistent way: e.g., MIG10 is migration bwtween POP1 and POP0; MIG102 is migration between 
####    an ancestral POP10 (or POP10anc - just so long as the numbers an only those numbers are there) amd POP2
####    (in an alternate tree structure, that could be migration between POP1 and POP02 instead - I beleive I have this correctly handled to parse out the correct pops)


#### This should be effective for any number of populations (of course, assuming they're structured exactly the way I 
####      name things in FSC), including migration among ancestral populations
